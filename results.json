  "body" : "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — As one of the NBA’s youngest teams for a second straight season, the Sacramento Kings are thinking long term. It’s not that the Kings are giving up hope on ending their 13-year playoff drought. The roster is laden with young and mostly unproven players, coupled with playing in a Western Conference that got even tougher with the arrival of LeBron James. So Sacramento’s focus is as much on development as instant success. “It’s a season where we’re going to commit to playing even more young guys than we have in the past,” Joerger said. “It’s an opportunity for guys to develop and it’s an opportunity for the organization to evaluate long-term which guys will still be considered a core guy two, three, four years from now.” That means a lineup that likely will be in flux most of the season – not surprising for a team that finished 27-55 a year ago. The Kings last made the playoffs in 2005. They have won more than 35 games just once since then. Most of the youth comes Sacramento’s last three draft classes. Point guard De’Aaron Fox, one of three first-round picks by the Kings in 2017, is the centerpiece of Joerger’s offense. Fox averaged 11.6 points but was inconsistent at times and struggled in the half-court offense. Justin Jackson, who started 41 games as a rookie, returns while center Harry Giles is expected to play a key role after sitting out all of last season recovering from a third knee surgery. Buddy Hield, a first-rounder in 2016, and Marvin Bagley III, the second overall pick in this year’s draft, will figure heavily into Joerger’s rotation. Hield will start in the backcourt alongside Fox while Bogdan Bogdanovic recovers from offseason surgery. Bagley should provide scoring relief while splitting time at power forward and in the post. “We have a lot of guys that need the experience,” Joerger said. “Each guy kind of brings a different thing to the party. I’m going to play them all. They all need to be developed.” MISSING BOGDAN Bogdanovic was one of the few bright spots during Sacramento’s up-and-down season, providing consistent scoring from the perimeter. But the second-year shooting guard is likely to miss the first month of the season after injuring his left knee playing for the Serbian national team in September. That means Fox likely will be likely without his backcourt mate for the first month of the season, a significant blow to the Kings offense. Bogdanovic led Sacramento in minutes played last season and averaged 11.8 points. He was the team’s third-best 3-point shooter and second in assists behind Fox. VET IN NEW ROLE Zach Randolph is the highest-paid player on the roster but could find playing time difficult to come by as the Kings move forward with their youth movement. The 37-year-old Randolph, who led Sacramento in scoring and was second in rebounding in 2017, was in and out of the lineup over the final month. Randolph still remain a big presence in the locker room because of his leadership, something Sacramento lost when Vince Carter signed with the Atlanta Hawks in the offseason. BUSY ON BOARDS Sacramento, one of the worst rebounding teams in the NBA last season, is looking to Bagley to change that. The 6-foot-11 Bagley was the ACC player of the year during his one season at Duke when he averaged a double-double, grabbing 11.1 rebounds a game. “He’s special,” Randolph said. “He’s got a great attitude, a tough mindset. He just has to keep working.” THE NEW GUY Joerger’s desire to improve the Kings depth and slow offense figured heavily in the decision to sign free agent Nemanja Bjelica in the offseason. Bjelica has traditionally been a stretch-four and Joerger likes him in that role when the Kings go small. But the 6-10 Serbian also could see time at small forward. Bjelica averaged 6.8 points for Minnesota last season while shooting nearly 42 percent from beyond the arc. MAN IN THE MIDDLE Given Joerger’s acknowledgment that he’ll reach deep into the bench this season, it’s unknown who will log the majority of minutes at center. Willie Cauley-Stein started 58 games and averaged 12.8 points and 5.2 rebounds last season for the Kings. But he’ll be a free agent next year and has stated his desire to cash in. That could open the door for increased time for Giles, Randolph, Bagley and Skal Labissiere. __ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map FS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes © 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.

  "body" : "Dwight Howard’s first preseason with the Washington Wizards is apparently over before it started. Howard needs an injection to alleviate pain in his back, and Washington coach Scott Brooks said that the eight-time All-Star has hopes of being back on the court by early next week. If it takes that long, that means Howard won’t appear in any of Washington’s preseason games. And if he doesn’t play in the preseason, that would cast doubt on Howard being ready when Washington’s regular-season slate starts against Miami on Oct. 18. “We’re going to take it day by day,” Brooks told reporters before Washington’s preseason game at New York on Monday night. Howard, who turns 33 in December, has always been durable. He missed a total of seven games in his first seven seasons, and played in 81 of 82 games with Charlotte last season. The one game he missed was while he was serving a suspension — and the Hornets wound up beating Memphis that night by 61 points anyway. But the back problems have kept Howard from practicing or playing with the Wizards so far in training camp and the preseason. For his career, Howard has averaged 17.4 points and 12.7 rebounds — averaging a double-double in each of his 14 seasons as well. Monday’s games: MAVERICKS 115, 76ERS 112 Luka Doncic scored 15 points, JJ Barea added 14 and Dallas topped Philadelphia 76ers to earn a split of the teams’ NBA China Games series. Joel Embiid led all scorers with 29 points for Philadelphia. MAVERICKS: Dallas’ Ding Yanyuhang scored one point and got one game ball. The Chinese rookie played the final 8:33, to the delight of the fans in Shenzhen, China. “We know how special this night is for Ding,” Barea said. 76ERS: Robert Covington scored 18 points for the 76ers, who got 10 points apiece from JJ Redick and Ben Simmons. Philadelphia committed 35 fouls for the second consecutive game. UP NEXT: Philadelphia’s preseason ended at 3-1. Dallas (2-1) hosts Charlotte on Friday. NETS 110, PISTONS 108, OT Brooklyn’s Allen Crabbe left less than 3 minutes into the game with a sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative. Reggie Bullock missed his first eight shots for Detroit, but got a layup — off an assist by Andre Drummond — to fall in the final seconds and force overtime. Drummond tried to send the game to potentially a second overtime, but missed from the left side of the lane with about 3 seconds left in overtime and lobbied unsuccessfully for a foul call. NETS: D’Angelo Russell led the way with 25 points. Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen each scored 17. PISTONS: Langston Galloway scored 24 points and Blake Griffin finished with 17, on a night in which Drummond had a 14-point, 10-rebound double-double — but missed 15 of his 21 shots. UP NEXT: Brooklyn (1-1) plays Toronto on Wednesday in Montreal. Detroit (1-2) hosts Washington on Wednesday. HORNETS 110, BULLS 104 Kemba Walker scored 20 points for Charlotte, which survived despite seeing what was a 23-point lead get trimmed to three with 1:11 remaining. Jeremy Lamb scored 16 and Cody Zeller added 14 for the Hornets. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 26 points, going 9 for 15 from the field and 4 for 6 from 3-point range. BULLS: Bobby Portis scored 17 points, Antonio Blakeney finished with 15 and Justin Holiday scored 10. … Jabari Parker grabbed 11 rebounds for the Bulls, all of them on the defensive end. Chicago got only four offensive rebounds all game. HORNETS: Malik Monk scored 13 points, Marvin Williams added 12 and Nic Batum finished with 12 rebounds. UP NEXT: Chicago (1-2) hosts Indiana on Wednesday. Charlotte (3-1) visits Dallas on Friday. PACERS 111, CAVALIERS 102 Victor Oladipo scored 23 points for Indiana, which led by as many as 24 on its way to winning in Cleveland. Domantas Sabonis finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Pacers. Kyle Korver led the Cavaliers with 17 points in just under 20 minutes. PACERS: Indiana led 59-39 at halftime. … Edmond Sumner and Tyreke Evans each scored 14 for Indiana, which is playing all four of its preseason games on the road. The Pacers don’t have a four-game regular-season road trip until the end of November, CAVALIERS: Cleveland had not trailed for a single second in its first two preseason games. The no-deficit streak ended 22 seconds after tipoff on Monday. … John Holland scored 13 points but first-round pick Collin Sexton struggled — shooting 1 for 7 and finishing with three points. UP NEXT: Indiana (2-1) visits Chicago on Wednesday. Cleveland (2-1) plays Detroit on Friday in East Lansing, Michigan. HEAT 90, MAGIC 89 Rodney McGruder led Miami with 19 points, and a short jumper with 1:35 left closed the scoring. Orlando had a chance to win it after grabbing a defensive rebound and calling time with 1.3 seconds remaining. Magic coach Steve Clifford put his starters back in and mapped out a play, but Nikola Vucevic’s lob for Aaron Gordon was knocked away by Miami’s Bam Adebayo and time expired. MAGIC: Vucevic had 22 points and 14 rebounds for Orlando, which rallied from 19 points down and wound up reclaiming the lead in the fourth quarter. Jerlan Grant scored 17 points and Gordon had 12 for the Magic. HEAT: Dwyane Wade made his last home preseason debut, scoring eight points. He’s expected to play in at least one of Miami’s two remaining exhibitions. … Goran Dragic scored 16 points and Hassan Whiteside added 13 rebounds and three blocked shots. UP NEXT: Orlando (1-2) hosts Memphis on Wednesday. Miami (1-3) hosts New Orleans on Wednesday. WIZARDS 110, KNICKS 98 Bradley Beal led Washington with 20 points, and the Wizards finished with seven players in double figures. It was a rough night for New York’s starting frontcourt. Kevin Knox, Lance Thomas and Noah Vonleh were a combined 3 for 18, finishing with a total of six points between them. WIZARDS: Jeff Green shot 7 for 10 and scored 16 points. John Wall finished with 14 points, nine assists and six rebounds in 27 minutes. KNICKS: Tim Hardaway Jr. and Allonzo Trier each scored 18 for the Knicks, who lost for the first time in this preseason. … Enes Kanter was held out of the game. UP NEXT: Washington (2-1) visits Detroit on Wednesday. New York (3-1) hosts Brooklyn on Friday. KINGS 132, MACCABI HAIFA 100 Buddy Hield scored 22 points on 9-of-11 shooting, including 4 of 4 from 3-point range, to lead seven Sacramento players in double figures. Justin Jackson made four 3-pointers and finished with 18 points, and Harry Giles III scored 16. Josh Childress, who played eight seasons in the NBA, led Maccabi Haifa with 18 points.

  "body" : "Deandre Ayton might be the NBA’s next great man in the middle. The No. 1 pick had a dominant debut Monday night, finishing with 24 points, 10 rebounds and three blocked shots in the Phoenix Suns’ 106-102 loss to the Sacramento Kings. The exhibition opener for both teams featured the top two picks in the most recent draft. Marvin Bagley III of Duke came off the Sacramento bench for seven points in 25 minutes. Ayton — Bagley’s one-time high school teammate — looks a little more NBA-ready. The former Arizona star leaped high for alley-oop and showed off a nice touch with a hook, finishing 9 for 16 from the floor and 6 of 8 from the free throw line. Joel Embiid, perhaps the league’s top current big man, matched up Monday with another top-10 center from the draft, Orlando’s Mo Bamba.

  "body" : "Kawhi Leonard’s debut in his new home arena will have to wait. Leonard was one of the regulars who rested Friday night, when the Toronto Raptors defeated Melbourne United 120-82. The Raptors scheduled five preseason games this season, but Friday’s was the only one that’ll be played in Toronto. Kyle Lowry also got the night off for the Raptors, who don’t play again in Toronto until the season-opener Oct. 17 against Cleveland. “You bring 20 guys to camp, it’s a little difficult to get all of them a decent look,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “There’s also a chance now to give some long extended minutes to some other guys.” Melbourne stayed with Toronto for much of the first half. After 18 minutes, Toronto’s lead was 34-31. Over the next 18 minutes, the Raptors outscored their Australian guests 67-27 and took a 101-58 lead into the fourth quarter. UNITED: Casper Ware and Chris Goulding led Melbourne with 17 points apiece. … Peter Hooley, whose 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left in the 2015 America East final gave Albany a 51-50 win over Stony Brook — and made headlines because Hooley was still grieving the loss of his mother, who died that season — had five points in 17 minutes. RAPTORS: Norman Powell led the winners with 21 points, and Pascal Siakam added 19. … Siakam was plus-50 in 27 minutes and Delon Wright, who finished with 15 points, was plus-49 in 26 minutes. … Besides Leonard and Lowry, the Raptors were also missing C.J.

  "body" : "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Sacramento Kings coach Dave Joerger wants his team to run more this season and plans to give speedy point guard De’Aaron Fox all the room he needs. Fox was one of the fastest players in the NBA last year as a rookie, but the Kings offense was uneven most of the season and frequently bogged down in the half-court. With an influx of young, quick players added to an already youthful roster, the hope is that Fox can get Sacramento out and running and, possibly, back into the postseason. “The best thing you can do for him is play fast and give him as much room as possible,” Joerger said Monday at the Kings practice facility during media day. “To play small and try to do that is best for De’Aaron. He’s our franchise guy. I think he is and I think everybody kind of agrees on that.” The fifth overall pick in 2017, Fox started 60 games and averaged 11.6 points with 4.4 assists, but shot only 41.2 percent while struggling with an inconsistent mid-range jumpshot. The Kings were 20th in the NBA with 10.4 fastbreak points. Those are numbers Fox hopes to improve in his second season. “That’s the way I’ve always played,” Fox said. “I’ve always played for a team that gets up and down, high school college, AAU, all of that. That’s what (Joerger is) emphasizing this year. I’m excited to see what happens.” The Kings drafted Fox with the first of their three first-round picks a year ago, but used him sparingly early while George Hill ran the point. Hill was eventually dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers as part of a multi-team trade. Fox flourished at times, but Sacramento struggled with its half-court offense and finished 27-55. Correcting the problems the Kings had there, as well as getting better in the fastbreak, are Fox’s main goals. “When we did do it, it was pretty effective but you don’t see too many young teams really executing at a veteran level in the halfcourt,” Fox said. “That’s something that I definitely need to work on as a point guard myself and us as a team.” Sacramento used the second overall pick this year on 6-foot-11-inch power forward Marvin Bagley III of Duke. Harry Giles, the 20th overall selection in 2017 who sat out his entire rookie season injured, is also back to add speed and size to the frontcourt. They also signed 6-10, 240-pound forward Nemanja Bjelica to play the stretch-four when the Kings want to go small. “Last year, our fastest lineup was playing Justin Jackson at power forward next to Bogdanovich and Buddy Hield,” Joerger said. “That group analytically would have been the fastest-paced team in the NBA. That serves to De’Aaron’s strength.” Better rebounding will also help, Joerger said. “It’s not easy to run when you’re always taking the ball out of bounds after a made shot,” Joerger said. “We have to try, try to get some stops. It’s fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals. It’s a commitment. DeAaron’s going to have to push it, but it takes all five guys.” Fox will be without his backcourt mate, Bogdan Bogdanovic, for the start of training camp. Bogdanovic underwent minor surgery Monday on his left knee after having a similar procedure done in April to repair a slight tear of the medial meniscus. No timetable has been given for his return. “It puts us behind a little bit,” Joerger said. “I was hoping to play he and Buddy Hield, either of them or play them together, at backup point guard. I wanted to see how that looks and put more scoring, shooting on the floor. So that will be a little behind.” Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map FS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes © 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.

  "body" : "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) Marvin Bagley III was adamant that he was the best player going into the draft and was quick to share that opinion when asked. The former Duke star wasn’t backing down after being taken by the Sacramento Kings with the second overall selection, either. ”That’s just the type of player I am,” Bagley said during a conference call with reporters. ”I’m going to have confidence in my game. I still think I’m the best player in the draft and I stand by that. I put a lot of work into it and I’m glad that I’ll be able to show it with Sacramento.” Bagley’s positioning in the draft had been a topic of debate in the days leading up to the draft, whereas 7-foot-1 center Deandre Ayton of Arizona was almost unanimously viewed as the top overall pick. The Phoenix Suns grabbed Ayton with the No. 1 pick, dropping Bagley to the No. 2 spot with Sacramento, which he says will give him added incentive heading into the NBA. ”It just lit a fire inside of me to want to play and compete at a high level,” Bagley said. ”So I’m happy it ended like that. Now all we can do is step out on the floor and play the game. That’s what it all is.” The Kings drafted another Duke player, Gary Trent Jr., with the 37th overall pick then traded him to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for two future second-round selections. Bagley will be a welcome addition in Sacramento’s frontcourt. The 6-foot-11 Bagley was AP’s player of the year in the Atlantic Coast Conference during his only season at Duke. He averaged 21 points and 11.1 rebounds while shooting better than 60 percent and has the ability to consistently finish at the rim. That is key for the Kings, who were inconsistent inside much of last season while finishing 27-55. ”Marvin is an elite talent in this draft, a great player,” Kings general manager Vlade Divac said. ”He’s a guy who works hard, wants to improve, learn, coachable, good teammate. Checks all the boxes that we want.” Divac had several options with the franchise’s highest pick since the Kings grabbed Pervis Ellison with the top overall pick in 1989. Missouri’s Michael Porter Jr. and Real Madrid sensation Luka Doncic were linked to Sacramento in the weeks leading up to the draft. Both were intriguing for different reasons, but there were questions about Porter’s health as well as concerns about Doncic’s ability to carry over his international success to the NBA. By contrast, Bagley is considered a safe pick who should help the Kings’ inside scoring and rebounding. ”Marvin is for us a better fit, a better player,” Divac said. ”It was an easy choice for us.” Bagley was one of four players in Division I to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in 2017. He joins a struggling franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006. Coach Dave Joerger’s young team showed flashes at times in 2017 but there was never an established starting lineup and players were shuffled in and out. Bagley played forward at Duke but could also get time at center in Joerger’s system. The 19-year-old is more of a scoring threat than last year’s starter, Willie Cauley-Stein, although both big men need more development on the defensive end. A more likely scenario is the two big men playing together to give the Kings an inside presence on both ends. Sacramento also has Skal Labissiere, who had an uneven season while dealing with injuries in 2017. Harry Giles, acquired in a draft-day trade from Portland a year ago, is also on the roster but didn’t play at all his rookie season after recovering from a torn ACL in his right knee. Bagley’s ability to play both forward positions and center will give Joerger flexibility within his lineup. ”He can play 3, 4 and 5,” Divac said. ”That’s what’s in Marvin’s unique talent, he can play multiple positions.” Bagley is eager to get started. He is due to fly to Sacramento on Saturday and has already been penciled in to play in the NBA’s summer league. ”I think I can bring a lot to a team, offensively and defensively, inside and out,” Bagley said. ”I’m very confident in my game and my abilities. I know how much work I put into this and how much I sacrificed for it. I’m excited to show the world, my team and my teammates everything I can do.” — More AP NBA:�https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map FS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes © 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.

  "body" : "Although the Timberwolves cracked the postseason field for the first time since 2004, it was clear they have a ways to go to match elite teams in the Western Conference such as Golden State and Houston. A blockbuster trade could help even the field. There are a couple of All-Star caliber players that could request a trade this offseason. Kawhi Leonard is unhappy in San Antonio, and the Toronto Raptors (think Kyle Lowry) could shake things up after losing to Cleveland (well, LeBron James) in the playoffs for the third straight season. Trading for a player like Kawhi would be costly, meaning the Wolves would have to part ways with Andrew Wiggins at the very least. But a starting lineup with Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns and Kawhi Leonard would be a tough, tough team to score on. Head coach Tom Thibodeau would have his pieces together on defense. The Timberwolves scooped up the Thunder’s first-round pick (No. 20 overall) after trading Ricky Rubio to Utah in the offseason. Can a team find value that late in the draft? The last four players to be selected 20th: Harry Giles (Portland), Caris LeVert (Brooklyn), Delon Wright (Toronto) and Bruno Caboclo (Toronto). Giles didn’t play a game in his rookie campaign due to knee issues and Caboclo has appeared in just 35 contests over four NBA seasons, but Wright and LeVert have found roles off the bench. Noteworthy players selected No. 20 include Evan Fournier (2012), Jameer Nelson (2004), Larry Nance (1981) and -- not that he did anything as a player -- but current Rockets head coach Mike D’Antoni (1973). The last time Minnesota had the No. 20 pick was 2011 when it selected Lithuania’s Donatas Motiejunas. The Timberwolves traded Motiejunas the next day (along with a certain point guard named Johnny Flynn) to Houston, and he went on to average 7.4 points in 248 games over five seasons for the Rockets and New Orleans. The 2018 NBA luxury tax threshold is $123 million and the salary cap max is $101 million, according to Spotrac. Minnesota has $113,773,675 committed to its active roster next season and $2,598,921 in dead money (payday for Shabazz Muhammad and Kevin Martin), placing the team $15 million over the cap with $6.6 million to work with in luxury tax space. That doesn’t give the Wolves a ton of room to breathe. If you're thinking the Wolves could create cap room by cutting someone, only last year's top draft pick, Justin Patton, would result in any dead cap money (he's owed $2.67 million next season). Minnesota could save almost $5 million by releasing Cole Adrich ($2,056,021 of his $6,956,021 would be dead cap). Jamal Crawford will opt out of the final season of his two-year deal he signed last summer. Minnesota could bring him back -- Butler reportedly wants that to happen -- but it’s not likely. What about Derrick Rose? The former league MVP averaged 14.2 points and 2.6 assists while shooting 7 of 10 from beyond the arc in five postseason games for Minnesota in the playoffs. The Rose-Thibodeau marriage, which dates back the 29-year-old’s third season in the NBA in 2010-11, could see another season. Nemanja Bjelica is a restricted free agent, meaning the Timberwolves can match any offer he receives around the NBA. Bjelica averaged 10.8 points and 6.8 rebounds per game as a starter (21 games) last season while filling in for an injured Butler. He was Minnesota’s second-best 3-point shooter at a career-best 41.5 percent. Aaron Brooks is also an unrestricted free agent while Marcus George-Hunt and Amile Jefferson are restricted free agents. Butler’s contract runs through next season, and he has a player option for 2019-20, but the four-time All-Star will likely want to cash in on another long-term deal sooner than later. That $20 million he’s owed for 2019-20 will be chump change around the NBA by that time (keep in mind Butler's AAV of roughly $18.5 million currently ranks 52nd among all NBA players). Butler will be 29 in September, meaning he probably only has one more massive deal left in his career. If Thibodeau is in Minnesota to stay, there’s no reason Butler wouldn’t want to be either. Minnesota will have to be strategic with the contract, as Karl-Anthony Towns in a restricted free agent after the 2019-20 season and has earned a hefty payday through his first three NBA seasons.

  "body" : "SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Rudy Gay scored 18 points, Manu Ginobili had 17 and the San Antonio Spurs rallied late to beat the Sacramento Kings 98-85 on Monday night and clinch their 21st straight postseason appearance. Sacramento, which was eliminated from the postseason on March 11, led by 14 points before being outscored 38-19 in the fourth quarter. Reserves Gay, Ginobili and Bryn Forbes combined for 25 points in the fourth quarter. Forbes finished with 11 points total. Willie Cauley-Stein led Sacramento with 25 points and 10 rebounds. De’Aaron Fox added 21 points, and Buddy Hield had 17. Forbes’ fast-break layup off a steal by Kyle Anderson gave San Antonio its first advantage at 68-67 with 10:21 remaining. Sacramento went back ahead seconds later when Hield hit a 3-pointer, and the lead changed three times after that before Ginobili and Gay gave the Spurs’ the edge for good. Gay and Ginobili had thunderous dunks in the final five minutes that helped San Antonio maintain small leads. Gay also had a 3-point play off a runner he tossed in and ripped the ball from Cauley-Stein while blocking the 7-footers shot. A 3-pointer by Forbes and a layup by Ginobili 30 seconds later to gave the Spurs an 82-77 lead with 5:23 remaining. LaMarcus Aldridge added 15 points and 14 rebounds but was 6 for 19 from the field. Sacramento forced the rally with some hot shooting through three quarters. Fox, who was shooting 30 percent from 3-point range for the season, made his first three 3s. He finished 3 for 5. The Kings had 11 offensive rebounds through three quarters to the consternation of the Spurs’ fans, who groaned louder with each. Sacramento shot 41 percent for the game. TIP-INS Kings: Fox’s season-high for 3-pointers is six against the Spurs on Jan. 28. … The Kings’ last victory over the Spurs was Nov. 15, 2014 in Sacramento and their last win in San Antonio was Jan. 20, 2012. … Sacramento was without Iman Shumpert (left knee surgery), Garrett Temple (sprained left ankle), Skal Labissiere (sprained left ankle), Frank Mason (sore left heel) and Harry Giles (knee rehabilitation). Spurs: San Antonio’s streak of playoff appearances is the longest active streak in the four major professional sports. The Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL are second with 12 followed by the NFL’s New England Patriots with nine and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the MLB with five. … Aldridge had his 27th double-double of the season, the most he has had in three seasons with the Spurs. The 12-year veteran had 26 double-doubles in his inaugural season in San Antonio and 18 last season. UP NEXT Kings: Host Houston on Wednesday night. Spurs: Visit New Orleans on Wednesday night.

  "body" : "The ACC’s basketball media day is Wednesday and one of the biggest stories will be the health of Duke star freshman Harry Giles. The 18-year-old power forward, who is being projected by some as the No. 1 pick in next year’s NBA Draft, underwent knee surgery earlier this month. It was the third different knee surgery for Giles since his sophomore year of high school, however, the most recent one was a simple knee scope, while the first two were for much more severe ACL tears. Giles is expected to miss a few weeks, but Coach K says it's nothing Duke fans should be too worried about. Coach K gave exclusive insight on the injury to FOX Sports’ new college basketball podcast, The Sidelines with Evan Daniels:  Coach K said that the surgery will actually help Giles’ overall health going forward: “Harry is still recovering health-wise. He had just a little bit of a setback in September. Not structurally, but we felt he should be playing already, but they had to scope. They kind of had to clean; not the knee he hurt 11 months ago, but the other one. And it was really good. And so, he’s recovering even better now, and he would have never have recovered as well if they hadn’t done this procedure. So, we’re hoping that we get him [healthy].” While it seems as if Giles underwent a relatively simple procedure, Duke fans are wondering when exactly he'll return to the hardwood. Coach K advised fans to be patient: “I don’t want to put a time pressure on him, because I don’t think he’ll be as honest [about how he is actually feeling]. You know what a great kid he is. He just wants to play, he loves to play. We’ve talked a lot, like ‘you’re going to do this slow, because you don’t just have this season ahead of you at Duke, but your whole future and we want to make sure we’re not just, just short-term making decisions, but long-term making decisions.” Credit to Coach K, who clearly he has Giles best interests at heart. It’s good to see that the coach isn’t so worried about this year in Durham specifically with Giles, as much as he is with (what is hopefully) the next 15 years in the NBA as well. To listen to Coach K talk about his final summer with Team USA, his time at Duke, and even a little insight on Lakers’ rookie Brandon Ingram, be sure to check out the entire episode of The Sidelines.

  "body" : "LAS VEGAS (AP) It’s been a bumpy ride for Atlanta Hawks point guard Trae Young, but he finally got his shot going. The No. 5 overall pick out of Oklahoma scored 24 points and made 7 of 13 3-pointers to help the Hawks defeat the Chicago Bulls 101-93 on Tuesday in the Las Vegas Summer League. Young looked like the player who led the nation in scoring and assists as a college freshman. ”I just try to play my game,” he said. ”I try to make the right plays, and if I see an opening, I’m going to knock it down or find my teammates. I’m just trying to get more into rhythm each and every game. I’m just trying to get better and progress and get better. That’s my main thing. I think I’m headed in the right direction.” Young made just 12 of 52 shots in three summer league games in Utah, and before Tuesday, he had shot just 29 percent in two games Las Vegas. After showing signs of figuring things out with a 21-point, 11-assist performance against New York this past Saturday, he suffered a minor right quadriceps injury on Sunday against Portland. He seemed fine on Tuesday, playing a team-high 33 minutes. It’s still just July and the sample size is small, but Young’s early struggles reflect the concerns about him being too frail, short and undisciplined to succeed in the NBA. Even in his breakout game against Chicago, he missed all six of his shots inside the 3-point line. Young isn’t the only high profile rookie point guard who has encountered rough times in Las Vegas, though. Second-round pick Jalen Brunson, The Associated Press National Player of the Year for Villanova, is averaging just seven points and shooting 19 percent from the field in three games for the Dallas Mavericks. Meanwhile, Cleveland’s Collin Sexton has been on point. The eighth overall pick out of Alabama is averaging 16.7 points per game and shooting 43 percent from the field in Las Vegas. Other rookie point guards have been shining in Las Vegas. – Los Angeles Clippers newcomer Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the 11th overall pick from Kentucky, is averaging 19.7 points and shooting 45 percent. – Houston’s De’Anthony Melton, the 46th overall pick from USC, is posting 16.3 points, 7.0 rebounds and 2.7 steals per contest. – Indiana’s Aaron Holiday, the 23rd selection from UCLA, has averaged 15 points, 5.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 2.7 steals. Tuesday’s summaries: TRAIL BLAZERS 95, SPURS 89 Gary Trent Jr. scored 20 points to help the Trail Blazers (3-0) hold off the Spurs. Trent, a second-round pick, made 4 of 8 3-pointers. Wade Baldwin IV scored 16 points Jake Layman scored 15 points for the Trail Blazers. Portland made 11 of 21 threes and outscored the Spurs 24-11 at the free throw line. Jaron Blossomgame and first-round pick Lonnie Walker IV each scored 12 points and Olivier Hanlan and Trey McKinney-Jones added 11 for the Spurs (1-2). The Spurs trailed by 13 heading into the fourth quarter but cut their deficit to two in the final minute before the Trail Blazers held on. HEAT 98, JAZZ 90 Bam Adebayo scored 24 points to help the Heat (1-2) top the Jazz. Ike Nwamu scored 18 points, Yante Maten scored 14 points and Duncan Robinson added 12 for the Heat, who made 27 of 30 free throws. First-round pick Grayson Allen had 17 points and seven rebounds for the Jazz (1-2). Diamond Stone scored 17 points, Georges Niang scored 12 points and Trey Lewis added 11 for Utah. The teams were tied at 47 at halftime, but Miami took control by outscoring the Jazz 30-19 in the third quarter. HAWKS 101, BULLS 93 Trae Young scored 24 points to help the Hawks top the Bulls. Young, the No. 5 overall pick, made 7 of 13 3-pointers and had five assists. Jaylen Adams scored 23 points, Jaylen Morris added 17 and Omari Spellman had 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Hawks (1-2). Wendell Carter Jr., the No. 7 overall pick, had 23 points on 9 for 13 shooting for the Bulls (1-2). Antonio Blakeney scored 23 points and Kaiser Gates added 14 for Chicago. Atlanta took over in the third quarter, outscoring the Bulls 30-21. KINGS 94, GRIZZLIES 80 Justin Jackson had 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting, Matt Jones added 15 points and the Kings (1-2) outscored the Grizzlies 27-12 in the third quarter to pull away. Harry Giles added 11 points and 12 rebounds and Frank Mason had 10 points and 13 assists. Ivan Rabb and Wayne Selden had 17 points apiece for the Grizzlies (1-2). LAKERS 109, KNICKS 92, Josh Hart had 27 points with four 3-pointers and Jeff Ayres added 17 points to help the Lakers (3-0) top the Knicks. The Lakers led 75-50 in the third, but No. 9 pick Kevin Knox scored 16 of his 29 points during a 30-3 Knicks run that gave New York (1-2) its only lead of the game early in the fourth quarter. Los Angeles responded with 16 straight points. Knox finished 5 of 7 from 3-point range and grabbed nine rebounds.

That number means that a total of 1,184 players are going to lose their jobs between now and Saturday afternoon. Under NFL rules, each team has to make their final cuts by 4 p.m ET on Saturday. Most teams started the cut making process on Friday and like always, there were be some shocking moves. One notable player who's already out of a job is Texans punter Shane Lechler, who was cut on Friday after Houston decided to move forward with rookie Trevor Daniel. During early cuts on Saturday, we saw two veteran defensive ends get released in Michael Johnson (Bengals) and Brian Robison (Vikings). The Patriots have also parted ways with running back Mike Gillislee, who scored three touchdowns in the team's regular season opener in 2017. The Cowboys also surprisingly cut ties with the team's all-time leading scorer, kicker Dan Bailey. Besides cuts, you'll likely also see a fair amount of trades this weekend and we've already seen a blockbuster one with the Raiders sending Khalil Mack to Chicago. Anyway, we'll be keeping tabs on every cut over the next 48 hours. The list below will be updated regularly with reported cuts and official cuts throughout the weekend.

  "body" : "Play Now FANTASY BASKETBALL Play Now FANTASY HOCKEY Listen Live Start or Sit (NFC Home Games) Dave Gettleman does not spend his free time waterskiing over sharks, but he has more in common with the guy from the Dos Equis commercials than you might think. At least over the next few months, because Gettleman is the Most Interesting Man in the Draft thanks in large part to him holding the keys to the Giants No. 2 overall selection. That pick, which is New York's first top-five pick since it drafted Philip Rivers fourth overall and traded him for Eli Manning back in 2004, is going to create a domino effect regardless of which direction the Giants go. New York has a plenty of options too, a Choose Your Own Adventure-style selection in front of it, with multiple paths the Giants could pursue depending on who Gettleman likes, what quarterback could fit with Pat Shurmur's offense and whether the Giants believe Manning can give them a few more quality seasons at quarterback. There has never been a better time to need a quarterback and possess a top pick. This draft is loaded with talent, thanks to Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen, Baker Mayfield, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Mason Rudolph all entering the draft process. But that combination of need and location also creates a fascinating economy for any team with a top pick and a veteran quarterback in place: the No. 2 pick is a much more valuable commodity than it might have been in any other year. Complicating matters is the presence of two top-tier prospects at positions of both need and interest to Gettleman: Saquon Barkley and Bradley Chubb did more than enough to bolster their already strong draft stock during the combine. Let's examine the options the Giants have in the coming months. This is the obvious choice. This is the smart choice, because logic dictates the Giants will not be in this position again with this loaded a quarterback class. The idea that 2017 was a bad class ended up being dumb and it appears Deshaun Watson, Mitchell Trubisky and Patrick Mahomes could all be viable starters, so it's not like this will be the last year to ever acquire a quarterback. But 2018's class appears to have multiple potential franchise quarterbacks between Allen, Rosen, Darnold, Mayfield, Jackson and Rudolph. They won't all pan out, but Gettleman's job is to navigate the waters and to select the best possible quarterback to take over once Eli's done playing. You just don't get many chances to get a franchise quarterback at the top of the draft if you're a well-run organization. The Giants are a well-run organization, despite some recent dysfunction. Even if you believe Manning, who will turn 38 at the end of this season, is capable of playing one or two more years, this is just about the perfect situation to get set up for the future. But winds are certainly swirling in a different direction right now. As Pete Prisco noted in a recent episode of the Pick Six Podcast (subscribe here on iTunes!), \"the word is they're not going to take a quarterback.\" Prisco was speaking based on the buzz coming out of the combine, which has been largely confirmed from other reports around the league. Notable from the combine was Gettleman providing as much praise for backup quarterback Davis Webb as one can offer for a quarterback with no career regular season passing attempts. \"We liked [Webb] down in Carolina [when Gettleman was GM] in the draft. He is pretty highly-rated,\" Gettleman explained. \"It is kind of like having a Christmas or a Hanukkah present that you get to unwrap eventually.\" Webb didn't get a look when Manning's streak was broken during the debacle of 2017, but he was a third-round pick and a quarterback who was coveted by plenty of people before the 2017 NFL Draft. It's entirely possible Gettleman sees him as a potential successor to Eli, or at least someone worth developing in that way. If that's the case, the Giants have a quarterback for now, a quarterback for later -- or at least one worth gambling on -- and the opportunity to spin the No. 2 pick into a different resource. It shouldn't have taken his performance at the combine for people to fall in love with Saquon Barkley, because this is what he did his entire career at Penn State. Barkley isn't a perfect prospect, even if one team told Peter King of TheMMQB.com they gave Barkley a perfect grade heading into the draft. It's understandable when you see his production on the field and compare it to his measurables. Penn State RB Saquon Barkley at 2018 Combine: - Stronger than Joe Thomas - Quicker than DeSean Jackson - Faster than Devin Hester - Jumps higher than Julio Jones@PennStateFball pic.twitter.com/usgR6vJvOn Break Barkley down by college production and what he did at the combine and he's basically a stronger David Johnson who put up his numbers against more difficult competition with a year less of wear and tear. There is a very good argument for not taking running backs in the top five: even as good as Todd Gurley, Ezekiel Elliott and Leonard Fournette were for their respective teams, the Rams could have had Landon Collins/David Johnson, the Cowboys could have had Jalen Ramsey/Derrick Henry and the Jaguars could have had Deshaun Watson/Alvin Kamara by utilizing earlier picks on prospects they were interested in and spending draft capital on a running back later. That's a best-case scenario, of course, but it just points out there is value later at the running back position in recent years. On the other hand, Barkley might not be there at No. 2 for the Giants, with the Browns reportedly interested in taking him No. 1 overall. If Barkley does slide past the top spot, don't think for a second Gettleman won't pull the trigger. Just last year, he drafted Christian McCaffrey with the No. 8 pick overall in Carolina. All due respect to the Stanford product, but Barkley is a much more complete back. He's bigger, stronger and a guy you can feature an entire offense around. Carolina struggled to really utilize McCaffrey in the run game (he had 117 carries versus 113 targets). That won't be an issue with Barkley, who could become the focal point of Pat Shurmur's offense. Gettleman has no qualms about positional value. \"The bottom line is: is the guy a football player? This whole myth of devaluing running backs, I find it kind of comical. At the end of the day, if he's a great player, he's a great player. It doesn't matter what position he is,\" Gettleman explained at the combine. \"Everyone has to understand that every player is important. That is why when you are looking at the second pick of the draft, which we are, the first thing we have to determine is, is this guy worthy of being the second pick of any draft? Not just this year's draft, of any draft. \"You make that determination and you move forward. [The reporters from Carolina] have seen my act down there. If he's a great player, I don't care how stacked we are at the position, we are taking him. It is all about accumulating talent.\" Lots of GMs tell lots of white lies, but Gettleman's been pretty true throughout his tenure running a front office: he is going to take the top guy on his board regardless of position. If Barkley is that guy, he'll take him. And there's a viable argument for it from a football standpoint too. The Giants need to get better on the offensive line, but it's not hard to fathom a situation where Andrew Norwell, drafted by Gettleman, leaves Carolina in free agency and heads straight up the eastern seaboard to New York. Keep the veteran quarterback, lock down the superstar wide receiver, ink a Pro Bowl, mauling guard to a free-agent contract and draft the explosive rookie running back. That's a good formula to come out of the gates firing with Pat Shumur's offense in Year 1. The Giants roster probably isn't built to contend right away, but they can certainly be competitive again in 2018. Barkley would help a lot in that regard. Another tenet of Gettleman's time in Carolina was his penchant for drafting some of the big boys who got down in the trenches, defensive and offensive linemen that the GM referred to as \"hog mollies.\" Typically speaking, these would be really thick fellas who work on the interior of the defensive line (Star Lotulelei and Kawaan Short qualify) or grinding guards on the offensive line (Trai Turner, Andrew Norwell). Notice a pattern with those drafted players while Gettleman was in Carolina? But it's safe to say there are two guys who would qualify in this draft: Bradley Chubb and Quenton Nelson. Chubb's not some oversized bear -- he's just the best pass rusher in this draft by a substantial amount and, arguably, the best player in the draft. Put him in a rotation with Jason Pierre-Paul and Olivier Vernon and suddenly the Giants are recreating exactly what helped them win a pair of Super Bowls, by generating a ton of pass rush off the edge. Worth noting is Vernon's contract, which could feature an out after 2018 (the Giants could save $11.5 million in cap space) and which only has two years remaining. JPP has three years left on his latest extension, but could be a cap casualty after the 2019 season depending on how his play holds up. In other words, the presence of those two talented ends does not preclude the Giants from drafting another pass rusher if Chubb is the best player on Gettleman's board. Nelson could fit the above description the GM provided for running backs too: he doesn't care if the former Notre Dame star is a guard. Is he a football player? A: Oh yes, yes he is. Here’s the best college OL, Quenton Nelson, chokeslamming and tea bagging a LSU DL... Savage...This dude is a sure fire NFL All Pro. @NDFootball pic.twitter.com/Mk0x9x02my Nelson is also confident. Notre Dame OG Quenton Nelson effectively selling the importance of guard play: \"You have guys dominating the NFL right now in Aaron Donald, Geno Atkins, Fletcher Cox, that have been working on interior guys. You need guys to stop them. I'm one of those guys.\"#NFLCombine2018 And strong. Did we mention strong? Notre Dame All-American G Quenton Nelson just beasted the bench press at the #NFLCombine \uD83D\uDCAA \uD83D\uDCFA: @nflnetwork on March 2-5 pic.twitter.com/9LMR83Xkyt Taking a guard at No. 2 isn't a \"traditional\" move, but if it's not clear, Gettleman isn't obsessed with traditional decision-making. He's going to take a football guy if he gets the chance and believes in the player. The top player available is coming off his board at No. 2, provided the Giants are still drafting there after the Browns make their first pick. Surprisingly, Gettleman sounded lukewarm about the idea of moving down out of the No. 2 spot when discussing it at the combine. \"Are we open for business? Any decision I make is going to be in the best interest of the New York Giants, plain and simple. If someone makes me an offer I can't refuse, would I move back? It depends upon who is there,\" Gettleman said. \"Again, if there is a guy that is worthy enough of being the second pick of a draft and what we are basically saying if we answer that question to the affirmative, you are drafting what you think is going to be a Hall of Fame player. You can't get too cute about the whole thing.\" It's not hard to look at this draft as having four quarterbacks (Allen, Darnold, Mayfield, Rosen) who will be top selections, along with a small group of prospects (Chubb, Barkley, Nelson, Minkah Fitzpatrick) who are elite at their position and have good odds at becoming Pro Bowl level players pretty quickly. That's not knocking the other players in the draft who will go high, it just feels a lot safer to be sitting at No. 2 or No. 4 this year than it does at No. 10, compared to most other seasons. Maybe the Broncos (No. 5) or Jets (No. 6) are interested in moving up to get a quarterback, but maybe Gettleman sees the Colts (No. 3) and Browns (No. 4) as teams likely to snare one or two of the players he's interested in drafting. Neither of those trading partners would offer a massive pile of future picks. This wouldn't be a Browns/Eagles or Rams/Titans type of deal we're talking about here. Barring some kind of huge bidding war -- it would mean a team like the Cardinals trying to move way up to get involved -- the Giants won't get multiple first-round picks in return for moving down a couple spots. It would hardly be surprising if Gettleman saw the players at the top of this draft and didn't feel some combination of second- and third-round picks were enough to warrant him moving down the draft board and risking his blue-chip guys coming off before he actually picks. Whatever the Giants do, though, there will be repercussions far down the draft board. If they get involved in the quarterback business, it's going to shrink the supply quickly, especially if Cleveland goes QB at the top too. The Colts No. 3 pick will skyrocket in value for teams interested in getting ahead of the Broncos and Jets (or the Browns if they go Barkley/Chubb first). If the Giants go Barkley, it will send shockwaves up and down the draft board, with a running back going second overall for the first time since Reggie Bush went to the Saints there back in 2006. (Bush, by the way, was the last top-five running back to win a Super Bowl with the team who drafted him.) It would be the third time a running back went in the first two picks since 1995. The same could be said for Nelson at No. 2; it would drastically shift a lot of boards. Chubb going to the Giants would put severe pressure on the Colts to make their move at No. 3, possibly taking Barkley there. And a trade, depending on who came up to the second pick, would send folks scrambling. The Browns may have two of the top five picks in this draft, but it's the Giants, and by extension Gettleman, who control how the board is going to shake out come late April.
